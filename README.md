# Extensions Setup Contracts

Some extensions (f.e. for CMS) can be installed not only from [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) but by copying all files to specific folder. If there are more than one way to do that, comes problem how easy to get info about all such extensions. For that this is contract library - to make easier to create standardized information about extensions readers. 

## Installation

To install and use this package, we recommend to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```bash
composer require imponeer/extension-info-contracts
```

Otherwise, you need to include manually files from `src/` directory.
